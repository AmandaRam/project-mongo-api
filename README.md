# Project Mongo API

In this project we have created our own RESTful API and then used Mongoose methods.

## The problem

I found this project harder to set up and understand than last weeks project. I have been using both Google and chatGPT in combination with the provided material in order to solve this task.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
